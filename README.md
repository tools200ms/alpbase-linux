# AlpBase Linux

**AlpBase** is an [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)-based distribution specifically designed for ARM devices, featured by headless setup. As it is based on Alpine, AlpBase is lightweight, enabling fast boot times. Most importantly, it is built with a security focus.

The installation is limited to: 
- flashing a memory card
- booting system
- waiting a bit as AlpBase grows file system, does initialization and checks

Finally after automatic reboot system is ready for user to login and finish installation by providing keyboard types, time zone etc..

AlpBase is available in the following editions:
